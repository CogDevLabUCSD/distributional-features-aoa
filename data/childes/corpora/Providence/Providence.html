Katherine Demuth and her research assistants at Brown University
compiled the Providence corpus from 2002-2005. The corpus contains
longitudinal audio/video recordings of 6 monolingual English-speaking
children’s language development from 1-3 years during spontaneous
interactions with their parents (usually their mothers) at home. The aim
of the study was to provide a corpus of phonetically transcribed data,
with linked acoustic files, for the purpose of studying early
phonological and morphological development. Collection and transcription
of the Providence Corpus (and the similar Lyon Corpus for French) was
supported by NIMH grant #1ROIMH60922. The participants included 3 boys
(Alex, Ethan, William) and 3 girls (Lily, Naima, Violet). Each child was
recorded for 1 hour every 2 weeks beginning at the onset of first words.
Two of the children have denser corpora, with weekly recordings from
1;3-2;10 (Naima) and 2;0-3;0 (Lily). The three girls (Lily, Naima, and
Violet) were also recorded monthly from 3-4 years. The total corpus
consists of 364 hours of speech. Audio is available for all children and
video is available for all children except Ethan, who was diagnosed with
Aspergers Syndrome at the age of 5. Both adult and child utterances were
orthographically transcribed using CLAN conventions, with the
audio/video files linked. Trained transcribers then carried out a broad
phonemic (SAMPA > Unicode) transcription of the child utterances. A
second trained coder then retranscribed 10% of each recording.
Reliability scores ranged from 80%-98% (discounting voicing errors) on
this second segment. In accordance with CHILDES rules, any use of data
from this corpus must be accompanied by the above reference.
