This directory contains data from three families, each of which had a
2-year-old son (Michael, Jimmy, and Tim). In each family, both parents worked during the day and
the children were in day care. Four 20-minute conversations between the
boys and their parents were recorded within a 2-week period of time. The
context was free play and the toys varied from session to session.
Sessions 2, 3, and 4 were transcribed and included in this corpus. The
other sessions are avail-able for future transcription. For one of the
families, three additional sets of data (12 sessions) were collected and
included in Demetras’ (1989) longitudinal analysis of grammatical
development and parent–child interactions. Thirteen of the 16 sessions
collected for this family were transcribed and included in this corpus.
