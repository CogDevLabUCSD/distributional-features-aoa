Valian, V. (1991). Syntactic subjects in the early speech of American
and Italian children. Cognition, 40, 21â€“81.

must be accompanied by at least one of the above references.

<h3>Project Description</h3>

These data were contributed by Virginia Valian in 1995 and reformatted
into CHAT later in that year. They were used as the empirical basis for
Valian (1991) that compared English and Italian development. However,
only the English data are available here. The corpus includes two
samples each from 21 children distributed across the following levels of
MLU:
<table>
<th>Child<th>MLU<th>Child<th>MLU
<tr><td>01<td>1.53<td>11<td>3.07
<tr><td>02<td>1.74<td>12<td>3.15
<tr><td>03<td>1.79<td>13<td>3.16
<tr><td>04<td>1.81<td>14<td>3.31
<tr><td>05<td>1.99<td>15<td>3.34
<tr><td>06<td>2.24<td>16<td>3.62
<tr><td>07<td>2.28<td>17<td>3.68
<tr><td>08<td>2.52<td>18<td>3.72
<tr><td>09<td>2.66<td>19<td>4.12
<tr><td>10<td>2.76<td>20<td>4.17
<tr><td><td><td>21<td>4.38
</table>

Utterances that were fully enclosed in parentheses in the original were
marked with the postcode [+V] in the reformatted version. It is not
clear why these utterances were placed entirely in parentheses in the
original. Strings of one or two words that were enclosed in parentheses
are marked in the form [%v material]. It is not clear why this material
was placed in parentheses.
