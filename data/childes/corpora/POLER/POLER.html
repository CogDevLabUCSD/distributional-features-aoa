<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>Plasticity of Language in Epilepsy Research (POLER) was a project
conducted by William Gaillard, Madison Berl (both of Children’s National
Medical Center, DC) and Nan Bernstein Ratner (UMD). The POLER children
in this directory are a subset of a larger number of children followed
by Gaillard et al. (2007), Berl et al. (2005), and Mbwana et al. (2009).
They are 25 children with epilepsy (CWE) matched by age and gender to
unaffected peers. The 25 CWE were further subdivided, as noted in
individual files, by time since onset of seizure disorder. Recent onset
children (CWE-R) were defined as those whose seizures had begun less
than a year before entry into the study; those defined as chronic
(CWE-C) had onsets more than 3 years previous to enrollment in the
study. This distinction caused CWE-C and peers to be slightly older, as
a group, than CWE-R and their matched peers. A chart is provided that
illustrates how children were matched pair-wise.

<p>Data are available for each child for a number of psychoeducational
and standardized language assessments.

<p>Transcripts are of the narrative elicitation task, which asked each
child to generate a story to the book “Frog, where are you?” after
children had been shown each set of plates in the story.

<p>Transcripts were originally annotated for fluency for a project
published by Steinberg et al. (2014), but were done in a format not
compatible with the more recently developed fluency codes in CLAN.
