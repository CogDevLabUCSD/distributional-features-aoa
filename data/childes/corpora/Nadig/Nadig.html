<h3>Warnings</h3>
<p>Warnings concerning the use of this data include: 
<ul>
<li>Limited attention was paid to the correct transcription of speech errors. 
<li>Limited attention was paid to overlapping utterances and hesitations.
<li>The French transcripts were transcribed using international French spelling but 
Quebec-French lexical items were spelled according to dialectal spelling conventions 
(i.e., the use of “faque” in lieu of “cela fait que”). Please refer to 
“Project-specific conventions” section below.
<li>Gems (i.e., @Bg, @Eg) mark 9 minutes of the interaction.
<li>Family-specific lexical items, child-invented lexical items, and neologisms all given @g markings. 
</ul>

<h3>Pseudonyms</h3>
<p>Only families who provided informed consent to have their
transcriptions contributed to CHILDES are included in this corpus.
Options for consent included either keeping all first names or replacing
first names with a pseudonym. Parents were informed that no other
identifying information (i.e., last names, birth dates, etc) would be
included on the transcript. Telephone numbers that were uttered during
the interaction were replaced with different numbers. 

<h3>Project Description</h3>
Funding for this project was awarded to Dr. Aparna Nadig via a nouveau
professeur-chercheur grant from the Fonds de recherche du Québec -
Société et culture in 2008. 

<h4>Data collection</h4>
<p>The overall goals of this project were to longitudinally examine word
learning in children with autism spectrum disorders (henceforth ASD) and
typically-developing children from both English-speaking and
French-speaking families in Montreal, Canada. The study employed a
variety of measures, including a natural language sample during
parent-child interaction. Families participated at three time points
over the course of a year (between 2009-2012). The first and last visits
were conducted at McGill University and included developmental
assessments and other experimental measures (i.e., fast mapping and a
non-word repetition task). The present language sample was collected at
the second time point (approximately 6 months after the first visit) and
was either conducted at the families’ home or at McGill University,
depending on the preference of the families.

<p>The language sample that comprises this corpus was collected during a
freeplay task in which the parent and child played with a standardized
set of toys for approximately 10 minutes and an experimenter video
recorded the session. At the end of 10 minutes the parent was asked to
clean up with the child. This freeplay task was often the first task of
the second visit, depending on the child’s interests. Pretend play was
another focus of the freeplay task; toys were chosen based on those
commonly used in the pretend play literature. Other activities during
this second visit included shared book-reading and a task examining how
parents teach children novel words.

<p>For the freeplay interaction, a blanket approximately 4x4 square feet
was laid down and parents were asked to try their best to stay on the
blanket and play with their child as they typically would. Toys
included: a tea set (two cups, saucers, spoons), colored blocks, two
dolls (a female doll and a small baby doll), a telephone (on the
telephone was a hologram of a horse), baby bottle, and a dump truck.
Families were videotaped and transcription was done from the video
recording.

<h4>Sampling procedure</h4>
<p>This study was conducted in the city of Montreal, Canada. The
mother-child dyads include both English-exposed (En) and French-exposed
(Fr) young children with ASD or typically developing children, and their
mothers.  Participants were included as En or Fr when their language
exposure across settings consisted of 75% or more of the respective
language by parent report.

<p>Children with ASD (36 – 74 months) were recruited in collaboration
with the Montreal Children’s Hospital Autism Spectrum Disorders Clinic,
as well as through flyers in the Montreal area. Inclusion criteria for
the children with an ASD included: a clinical diagnosis of Autism
Spectrum Disorder, most often from a multi-disciplinary autism
evaluation team at the Montreal Children’s Hospital, meets criteria for
ASD on the The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT;
Robins, Fein, & Barton, 1999; 2 or more “critical items” are failed OR
when any three items are failed), The Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al., 2000; score of 7 or higher), absence of
other medical conditions associated with autism (e.g. fragile X
syndrome, tuberous sclerosis); absence of physical disability that would
interfere with completing the study procedures, ability to sit and work
to complete developmental testing and study tasks.

<p>Typically-developing children (henceforth TYP; 12 – 57 months) were
recruited from the McGill Infant Research Group Database.  Inclusion
criteria for the typically-developing children included no symptoms of
autism based on parent report and the MCHAT; no developmental, learning
or behavioral disorder by parent report; no history of significant
medical complications or conditions; no 1st or 2nd degree relatives with
an ASD; absence of physical disability that would interfere with
completing the study procedures. Typically-developing children were
recruited to match children with ASD on language ability. Many children
with ASD experience a significant language delay; therefore the TYP
children were substantially younger than the children with ASD as a
group.

<h4>Transcription protocol</h4>

<p>There were a total of 3 French-speaking (undergraduate students in
Psychology, Neuroscience, and Anatomy and Cell Biology) and 3
English-speaking transcribers (two graduate students in Communication
Sciences and Disorders, 1 undergraduate in Psychology); all were native
speakers of the language they transcribed. All but 1 (i.e., the project
manager) were blind to the child’s diagnostic group and videos were
assigned to transcribers to ensure that each transcriber encountered
approximately the same number of children with ASD, TYP children, as
well as higher and lower language levels. This assignment was done by a
project manager; demographic and group status information was never
provided to all transcribers (except for the project manager). Each
video was viewed twice, with each time by a different transcriber. The
first transcriber completed the transcription and the second transcriber
reviewed the original transcription for utterance breaks, possibility of
deciphering unintelligible utterances, and adherence to CHAT
conventions. Any large discrepancies between the first and second
transcriber were noted on a protocol sheet for later review. No
transcriptions needed to be reviewed.

<p>Transcribers worked in a quiet room and wore headphones while
watching the video recording using Windows Media Player. The full
duration of the interactions (approximately 10 minutes) were
transcribed. Gems mark approximately 9 minutes of transcription. When
applicable, utterances breaks were determined by clear intonational
markers such as questions or exclamations. All other utterances were
determined by a clear pause followed by a breath. If an utterance was
difficult to comprehend, transcribers were told to listen to the segment
a maximum of 3 times before transcription. If the utterance was still
unintelligible, the portion or full utterance was marked with an “xxx”.
If there was an overlap between speakers, the transcriber was to first
pay attention to the parent utterances, then the child utterances. All
CHAT conventions applicable to the present study were provided in an
abridged manual, which was made available in printed and electronic
forms. The original manuals provided by CHILDES (v2000) were also made
available.

<h3>Project-specific conventions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gems mark 9 minutes of the interaction. 
<li>Odd numbered files (i.e., 101) = TYP children; Even numbered files = ASD children.  
There are 12 English ASD children and 8 French ASD children.
<li>100 series (e.g., 101) = English-speaking families; 200 series (e.g., 201) = French-speaking families. 
Group assignment is also noted in the child’s speaker tier.
<li>The child’s age reflects his/her age at the time of the interaction.
<li>Where available, parent education levels for mothers are provided in the speaker tier. 
These reflect the highest degree received and mothers fell into one of three categories:
<ul>
<li>Less than undergraduate
<li>Undergraduate
<li>Higher than undergraduate
</ul>
<li>Because of the difficulty with distinguishing between child-invented
lexical items, family-specific lexical items and neologisms, all were
denoted with @g symbols.
<li>Spellings for Québecois expressions include: hein, hen, donc, euh,
and faque.
<li>Fixed phrases in French were denoted with a “+” symbol (words with
“+” are included in the table below). These were adapted from a list
provided by the lab of Elin Thordardottir (McGill University), in their
adapted manual of SALT conventions for French. The following is a
comprehensive list of the fixed phrases used in our sample.

<h3>Biographical data</h3>

<p>Biographical data for the child include: child’s age, gender,
diagnostic group, and language are provided. Biographical data for the
parent include: parent gender, education and language.
At the time of data collection, all families lived in the greater
Montreal, Canada area. Montreal is commonly referred to as a bilingual
city (i.e., English and French), although the official language is
French. French-speaking families were made up of a few different
dialects, although the majority spoke Quebec-French; dialectal
information per family was not collected.

<p>In order to participate in the study, parents reported that their
children were exposed to English-speaking or French-speaking
environments for =>75% of the time per week. However, some families did
not have English/French as a native language. Any additional languages
spoken by the families are noted. Occasionally English-speaking and
French-speaking parents would use words in the other language; for these
words, the CHAT conventions of @s:fre or @s:eng codes are used for the
respective lexical item.

<p>The majority of families were recorded in their homes. Other families
were recorded at McGill University in our testing facility.
